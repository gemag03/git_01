In realms of love, where souls unite,  
A tapestry of feelings takes flight.  
Like whispers on a tender breeze,  
Love weaves its spell with gentle ease.  

A symphony of hearts in tune,  
Embracing light from moon to moon.  
It dances through the starlit night,  
Bathing lovers in its radiant light.  

Love blooms in gardens, soft and rare,  
Where passion blossoms, free from care.  
It paints the world in vibrant hue,  
Creating vistas, ever anew.  

With every beat, love's rhythm plays,  
Enchanting souls in myriad ways.  
From whispered vows to tender touch,  
Love's language speaks of oh so much.  

It knows no bounds, this cosmic force,  
Connecting souls on its endless course.  
In laughter shared and tears held tight,  
Love's embrace can heal the darkest night.  

It's found in smiles, in stolen glances,  
In passionate embraces, love advances.  
Through stormy seas and tranquil seas,  
Love navigates with gentle ease.  

Love is the bridge that spans divide,  
Uniting hearts on love's sweet tide.  
In timeless realms, its power thrives,  
Where love's eternal flame survives.  

Through fiery trials and trials of ice,  
Love's flame burns strong, love's sacrifice.  
It lights the way when shadows fall,  
Guiding hearts through love's eternal call.
